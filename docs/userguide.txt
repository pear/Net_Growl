== Introduction

image:images/net_growl_256.png[alt="Net_Growl logo"]

Net_Growl is a PHP Library that makes it possible to easily send a notification
from your PHP script to http://growl.info[Growl]. indexterm:[Growl]

Two different protocols may be used: the basic UDP (compatible with all platforms),
and the new one GNTP (compatible only with Windows).

The major version 2 is a full rewrites to PHP5, that used exceptions to raise
errors.

PHP4 versions are no more supported. If you want one of them, you should consider
to have a look on these solutions :

* link:http://pear.php.net/package/Net_Growl[PEAR::Net_Growl] 0.7.0 - UDP only
* link:http://growl.laurent-laville.org/bin/Net_Growl-0.9.0b2.tgz[] 0.9.0 beta2 - UDP (full) + GNTP (partially)

CAUTION: I recommand to migrate to PHP5, because I don't gave anymore support for PHP4 versions

This manual documents the final stable version 2.2.0

== Features

* Register your PHP application in Growl. indexterm:[Growl]
